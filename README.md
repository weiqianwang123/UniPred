# UniPred  
Unifying Deep Predicate Invention with Foundation Models for Robotics  

UniPred is a research framework for learning, grounding, and evaluating symbolic predicates from perception and interaction.  
This repository is under active development. All sections below are intentionally marked as TODO.

---

## Teaser Figure  

A single overview figure that illustrates the full UniPred pipeline  
from raw perception  
to predicate induction  
to downstream planning and control  

TODO  
• add a clean pipeline style teaser figure  
• show perception to predicate to planning flow  
• include both simulation and real world settings  

---

## Demo Videos  

### Main Demo  
A long duration demonstration showing stable autonomous execution  
including perception  
predicate grounding  
and closed loop task completion  

TODO  
• add long horizon stable run demo  
• show no manual intervention  
• highlight predicate usage during execution  

### Failure Recovery Demos  
Short looping animations demonstrating robustness  
including recovery from perception errors  
action failure  
and environment perturbations  

TODO  
• add multiple short animations  
• each focuses on a different failure mode  
• clearly annotate recovery behavior
